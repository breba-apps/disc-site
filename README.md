# disc-site

DisC stands for Documentation is Code. It is a concept where an AI agent reads natural language instructions 
and executes them similar to how an interpreter executes python code instructions.

`disc-site` is a DisC solution for generating highly personalized websites.

## The Problem

The internet has deviated from its original promise of providing information that you need on demand and here are some reasons why:
* Ad driven platforms are using opaque algorithms to guide your discovery of information
* Attention harvesting platforms create distractions instead of focusing on what you need
* Algorithms impede discovery of internet resource by giving you a siloed experience

All of that makes users exposed to suboptimal, impersonal, and in some cases harmful presentations internet resources. For example:
* For people who love outdoors, weather websites require many interactions to find the right information wasting much time.
* News aggregators try to feed you clickbait, misinformation, and keeping you in a bubble.
* Social media platforms have focused on attention harvesting instead of facilitating meaningful interactions with your friends and communities.
* And for all of the above, popups and ads litter the screen obscuring content useful to you.
* Flashy ads purposefully trying to get clicks from kids
* Countless other examples exist

## The Solution
What if you could build software by typing up the requirements without writing any code? 
What if you could program your own AI assistants using nothing but your native language?

With the advent of useful LLMs and using Event Driven Agentic Architectures, `disc-site` will allow every human to build their own sites by simply typing in their own native language.
